# Editorial Standards

## How the Thesis Was Developed

The thesis was written by Jay Jahns and refined through structured review with three AI models (Claude, Gemini, GPT). Each model reviewed independently, provided feedback, and the author incorporated changes through multiple revision cycles. The process itself demonstrated the calibration loop the thesis describes.

## Voice and Style

- Direct, terse prose. Short sentences. No hedging.
- No em dashes used as decoration. Use them for parenthetical breaks only.
- No "genuinely," "honestly," "straightforward," or other filler.
- No bolding the first word of a sentence as a structural device. Use headers.
- Headers do the structural work. Body text stays as prose.
- The thesis reads like an operator describing observed failure modes, not a movement text announcing doctrine.

## Identity

- The standard is "The Lean Context Standard." Not the "spine pattern" (externally claimed).
- The structure is "three tiers" or "constitution, manifest, supply." Not a named pattern.
- The four rules: Workbench, Shadow Board, Pull, Andon. Four rules, not five.
- "The legibility of pull" is a sub-section of the Pull Rule, not a separate rule. It uses `<em>` not `<strong>` in the thesis.
- 5S is the ancestor. We absorbed it. We do not enumerate a parallel list of disciplines that maps 1:1 to 5S.
- Pillar pages frame OUR principles derived from lean, not lean concepts with our names on them.

## Tool Integration

- The constitution is the canonical file: `CONSTITUTION.md`.
- Agent tools expect their own filenames: `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), `AGENTS.md` (GitHub Copilot), `.cursorrules` (Cursor).
- Bridge the gap with symlinks: `ln -s CONSTITUTION.md CLAUDE.md`. One source of truth, multiple entry points.
- The symlink pattern is documented on the landing page and framework page. Include it in adoption guidance.

## Content Changes

- The thesis is a published document. Edits should be corrections or clarifications, not rewrites.
- Pillar pages (problem, framework, impact) are living documents and can be updated freely.
- Blog and about pages are living documents.
- All claims should be checked against the referenced research before modification.
- New sections need to earn their place — if they restate an existing point, they should be merged or cut.
